<!-- 
  To use:
    Open this file in a browser directly (no need to serve this through a web server)

  Requirements:
    RabbitMQ server with STOMP and STOMP WebSockets plugins enabled (this is not enabled by default)
    Run this command from this folder to launch a docker instance running RabbitMQ with the required plugins enabled.
      docker run -d --name rabbitmq-stomp-unit-test -p 25672:5672 -p 8888:15672 -p 15674:15674 -v ${PWD}/tests/rabbitmq.config:/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config rabbitmq:3-management

  Cleanup:
    Terminate and remove the docker container
      docker stop rabbitmq-stomp-unit-test
      docker container rm rabbitmq-stop-unit-test

  This simple example does the following:
    - Connects to RabbitMQ using STOMP protocol over WebSockets
    - Publishes a number every 500ms to an exchange with a routing key
    - Subscribes to this exchange with a wildcard binding key and receives these published messages
    - Disconnects after 10 seconds

  All results are output the the developer console.

  NOTE: In order to be able to publish and subscribe to exchanges (aka groups) they must already be defined in RabbitMQ
  the current code uses 'amq.topic' as these are provided by default by RabbitMQ.
